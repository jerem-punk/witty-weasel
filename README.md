# Witty Weasel 🐀

**Witty Weasel** is a lightweight development environment for crafting, testing and building bookmarklets with ease and fun.

Bookmarklets are tiny scripts that run in your browser with a click.  
They're like digital tricks you can keep in your bookmarks bar.  
Developing them efficiently is often a pain: constant rebuilds, copy-pasting, and reloads…

**Witty Weasel** makes this process smoother by letting you:

- Write modular JavaScript in `src/`
- Automatically bundle it using `esbuild --watch`
- Serve the result on a local dev server
- Instantly load the latest version in any tab via a single bookmarklet

It's snappy, sneaky, and smart — just like its namesake 🐀
